Task-1
implementing a simple autiencoder using keras for the Fashion MNIST dataset.
it consists an encoder and a decoder with a single hidden layer in between

Task-2
it implements a deep autoencoder using the Fashion MNIST dataset with an architecture consisting of three hidden layers

Task-3
Adding noise to the Fashion MNIST dataset and training an autoencoder to denoise the images

Task-4
Training an autoencoder to denoise Fashion MNIST images corrupted with Gaussian noise.
